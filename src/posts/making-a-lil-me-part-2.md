Note to self, do not start a 2 part blog post during a pandemic.

Sorry this took a while - I was prioritising work, <a href="http://localhost:8080/speaking/getting-started-with-svg-animation/">my workshop</a> and (frankly) my mental health.

If _anyone_ is still even remotely interested - let's crack on. ðŸ˜Š

So, this is where we left off - We had some mouse values - lets's see how to plug those values into an SVG and create some 'faux-3D' movement. - The fun bit!

We're not really going to be changing much of this code. We'll just be applying the values from the mouse movement to elements inside an SVG instead of the pointer.

SVG code can be hella lengthy and messy to look at though - so here's a little example of what we have inside the SVG.

```html
<svg viewBox="0 10 211.73 180">
  <path class="ear-left" d="M63....z" />
  <path class="ear-right" d="M68.54..." />
  <path class="face" d="M124..." />
  <path class="glasses" d="M133...." />
  <path class="hair-front" d="M124..." />
  <path class="hair-back" d="M174..." />
</svg>
```

It's basically lots of paths and shapes that make up different parts of the face.
This is the cool thing about SVG, unlike JPG's or PNG's you can get inside them and manipulate different parts of them with code. They even have a DOM, just like HTML. - Check this out.

The trick to 'fake' 3D movement is to create an illusion of perspective by moving the parts of the face in the background â€“ like the hair â€“ slightly less than the bits in the foreground â€“ like the glasses.

The x and y values here are the values we got in part 1. A range between -50 and 50.

The adjusted face range will be moving the face background **very slightly** by 1.6% of it's height and width, whereas the inner face will be moving **a little more** 8.3% of it's width at height.

```js
// the face itself
gsap.to('#face', {
  xPercent: x / 30,
  yPercent: y / 30
});

// glasses, eyebrows, cheeks and stuff
gsap.to('#innerFace', {
  yPercent: y / 6,
  xPercent: x / 6
});
```

A little tip.

You can pass the dom element itself straight into a GSAP tween, but when I'm animating stuff that'll be updating frequently, like mouse reactive animation, I tend to assign the DOM elements to variables so that the DOM is hit less. It's only a small performance gain - but small wins are important with animation!

```js
// Get the elements that we need
const dom = {
  face: document.querySelector('.face'),
  eye: document.querySelectorAll('.eye'),
  innerFace: document.querySelector('.inner-face'),
  hairFront: document.querySelector('.hair-front'),
  hairBack: document.querySelector('.hair-back'),
  ear: document.querySelectorAll('.ear'),
  eyebrowLeft: document.querySelector('.eyebrow-left'),
  eyebrowRight: document.querySelector('.eyebrow-right')
};
```

And that's the lot!

Here's the final pen with some adjusted values for the different bits of the face - There's no clever maths here - I just tweaked until it looked and 'felt' right.

Have a go at tweaking the values. Breaking stuff is the best way to learn!
